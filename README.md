# Project Overview

The project aims to deploy a WordPress application within a securely built environment that is both highly available, scalable and fault tolerant.

The use of AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFront, Route 53, ELB, and ASG ensures that the application is highly available, resilient, and scalable. 

This project can also be categorized as a LAMP Stack Project. A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP.
